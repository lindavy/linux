# HW 1: Discovering VMX Features of Intel Processor
The assignment doesn't require us to edit anything in the kernel itself, 
Starter code is already given, we made the mappings between control numbers and the descriptions.

Linda Nguyen wrote the mappings for exit controls and primary procbased controls and Dhruwaksh Dave wrote the mappings for Entry controls and secondary procbased controls.

Steps:
1. In the cmpe283-1.c file define pre-processor directives for IA32_VMX_ENTRY_CTLS, IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2, IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS and IA32_VMX_EXIT_CTLS with their MSR indices
2. Define the respetive structs of capability_info for all the controls. These mappings can be found in Intel SDM 24.6.1 and onwards.
3. Now edit the detect_vmx_features and write the code for all the controls in a similar fashion as the one predefined for pinbased controls.
4. Save the file and use the "make" command to get the compiled files and kernel object.
5. Execute the command "sudo insmod cmpe283-1.ko". If everything goes smoothly, no output will be shown.
6. Run the command "dmesg" and the end of this output stream will have the necessary output.
